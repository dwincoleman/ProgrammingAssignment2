## These functions [1] consruct an artificial matrix by analogy to makeVector
## [2] given matrix as input, check cache for its inverse;
## if found, return it, else calculate the invere and cahe it

## This functin creates the artifical matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function does the  inverting and caching, or fetching the inverse, as required

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
